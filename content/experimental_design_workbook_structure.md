# Experimental Design Workbook -- Recommended Structure

## Overall Teaching Objective

Enable students to reason about **experimental design choices**,
understand how those choices define the **design space**, and recognise
how experimental design constrains and enables downstream data analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 1 --- From Scientific Question to Experimental Design

**Purpose:** Frame the problem before any data exists.

**Key ideas:** - Scientific question vs experiment - Controlled vs
measured variables - Practical constraints (time, resources, noise)

**Student activity:** - Identify what can be controlled and what is
measured - Reflect on constraints

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 2 --- Experimental Design as a Method

**Purpose:** Introduce experimental design as a systematic methodology.

**Key ideas:** - Design space (each controllable variable is a
dimension) - Factors and levels - Factorial design (conceptual, not
mathematical) - Coverage vs resolution - Replication as a design choice

**Student activity:** - Reflect on which dimensions of the design space
matter most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 3 --- Exploring the Design Space Interactively

**Purpose:** Allow students to explore how design choices affect
outcomes.

**Key ideas:** - Distinction between design parameters and system
parameters - Trade-offs between time points, conditions, and replicates

**Interactive elements (optional):** - Adjust number of time points -
Adjust number of glucose levels - Adjust number of replicates - Explore
replicate-to-replicate variability

**Student activity:** - Reflect on which design choices most strongly
affect interpretability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 4 --- Implementing One Specific Experimental Design

**Purpose:** Fix a single design and commit to it.

**Key ideas:** - Synthetic data generation as an implementation of a
chosen design - No further design changes allowed without re-running the
experiment

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 5 --- Dataset Structure as a Design Outcome

**Purpose:** Connect experimental design to data structure.

**Key ideas:** - Dataset dimensions arise directly from design choices -
Missing dimensions reflect unmeasured aspects of the system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 6 --- Visual Exploration: What the Design Allows Us to See

**Purpose:** Interpret data within the constraints of the design.

**Key ideas:** - Patterns enabled by the chosen design - Patterns that
cannot be resolved due to design limitations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 7 --- Summary Statistics and Information Loss

**Purpose:** Understand the consequences of aggregation.

**Key ideas:** - Information lost through summarisation - When summary
statistics are appropriate and when they are misleading

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 8 --- Design Alternatives and Trade-offs

**Purpose:** Develop design reasoning without running new experiments.

**Key ideas:** - Alternative designs - Trade-offs between resolution,
replication, and coverage - Resource-aware decision making

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guiding Principle

Data analysis does not begin with data --- it begins with experimental
design.
